**A little about me:**
* I graduated Summa Cum Laude from UMass Amherst with a dual degree in Public Health and Math. 
* I currently work at Liberty Mutual Insurance as part of their Analyst Development Program. 
* I will be pursuing my MS in Health Data Science at Harvard University beginning in Fall 2023. 
* I am passionate about the United States healthcare system and want to see it improve. 

**My Goal:**
> I've always wanted to find a way to transform the United States healthcare system and make it more accessible for individuals. 
I want individuals from all different backgrounds and socioeconomic statuses to have equal access to healthcare and I want to use data to do it. I am invested in learing about machine learning and AI tools to work towards thi goal. I think if data was more accessible and understandable then the disparities in our healthcare system would be more recognizable and more people would push for change. I want to create easier and cheaper alternatives such as apps for data visualization so that common people can understand the data and so that there is a universal push for change.

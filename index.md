**A little about me:**
* I graduated Summa Cum Laude from UMass Amherst with a dual degree in Public Health and Mathematics. 
* I am currently a graduate student at Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health pursuing my MS in Health Data Science. 

**My Goal:**
> I want to change the way we look at and treat mental illness. I think data science, biostatistics, and AI is the way to go about this. I plan on continuing to learn about mental health and data science to develop my skills in order to eventually make a difference for those struggling with mental illness.

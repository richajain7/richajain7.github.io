**A little about me:**
* I enjoy playing the guitar
* I am passionate about learning about the United States healthcare system 
* I love problem solving and am always open to a challenge

**My Goal:**
> I've always wanted to find a way to transform the United States healthcare system and make it more accessible for individuals. 
I want individuals from all different backgrounds and socioeconomic statuses to have equal access to healthcare and I want to use data to do it. 
I think if data was more accessible and understandable then the disparities in our healthcare system would be more recognizable and more people would push for change. I want to create easier and cheaper alternatives such as apps for data visualization so that common people can understand the data and so that there is a universal push for change.
